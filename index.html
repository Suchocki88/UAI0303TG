                        <h4>üîë The Big Idea</h4>
                        <p>Lesson 3.3 introduces a counter-intuitive concept: <strong>sometimes providing MORE context makes AI output WORSE.</strong> Through the hummingbird passage comparison, students discover that context can constrain AI to generic patterns, and that strategic sequencing (building accurate foundation first, then transforming) often produces better results than trying to achieve everything in one prompt.</p>

                    <h3>Note on Lesson Type Change</h3>

                        <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Originally Listed as Discussion Day</h4>
                        <p>The Table of Contents originally listed 3.3 as a Discussion Day, but this lesson contains core conceptual content that students need to learn before they can meaningfully discuss its application. We've redesignated this as a <strong>Lesson Day</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Students will have extensive opportunity to discuss and apply these concepts</strong> during the four upcoming Lab Days (3.4-3.7), where context decisions become practical troubleshooting challenges.</p>

                    <h3>The Pedagogical Innovation: The "Easier to Write" Question</h3>
                    
                    <div class="success-box">
                        <h4>‚úÖ Why This Question Works</h4>
                        <p>The lesson asks students: <strong>"Which passage was easier to write?"</strong></p>
                        <p>Students will assume the shorter, punchier version was easier ("It's so simple!"). The reveal‚Äîthat the academic version was actually easier because it had scaffolding, reference materials, and established patterns‚Äîsets up the key insight about strategic sequencing.</p>
                        <p><strong>This creates cognitive dissonance that drives learning.</strong> Students must revise their assumptions about what makes writing "easy" or "hard."</p>
